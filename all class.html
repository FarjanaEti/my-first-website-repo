      </i>
     <p>
     The designation of Sajek Valley is derived from the Sajek River, which originates from the Karnaphuli River.[1] Previously considered one of the most remote regions due to its challenging steep terrains and lack of significant economic activity,[4] the valley has settlements dating back to 1885.[5] Tourism commenced in early 2010's, following the establishment of a road network connecting the valley to the rest of the country. The construction of this road was undertaken by the Bangladesh Army and took approximately 10 years to complete. As of 2020, there are 83 registered resorts in the region, up from six in 2016.[4] In 2020, tourism was temporarily halted for five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[6]

      <h3 align="center"><i>Environment in sajek</i></h3>  
     <p align="justify">Sajek Valley is known for its natural environment and is surrounded by green mountains, dense forests, and hilly terrain. Many small rivers flow through the mountains, among which the Sajek (also Kasalong) and the Masalong are notable. On the way to Sajek Valley, one has to cross the Mayni Range and the Mayni River. The road to Sajek features steep inclines and descents.[2]
      The inhabitants of Sajek Valley comprise various ethnic minority groups, including the Chakma, Marma, Tripuri, Pankho, Lushai, and other indigenous communities. In this community, there is a notable involvement of women in economic pursuits, particularly in activities such as fruit and vegetable picking. While proficiency in Bengali may not be widespread among them.
